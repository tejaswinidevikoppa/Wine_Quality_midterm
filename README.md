## Introduction

Wine quality is a topic of great interest in both the wine industry and among consumers. This project explores a dataset of red wines to understand how various chemical properties correlate with wine quality. The dataset provides insights into which factors might influence the perceived quality of red wines.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains information on the following features:
- `fixed acidity`
- `volatile acidity`
- `citric acid`
- `residual sugar`
- `chlorides`
- `free sulfur dioxide`
- `total sulfur dioxide`
- `density`
- `pH`
- `sulphates`
- `alcohol`
- `quality` (target variable)

The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `winequality-red.csv`.

## Methodology

The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Checking for missing values and ensuring data integrity.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing various visualization techniques to explore relationships between features and quality.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Performing a t-test to assess the significance of alcohol content differences between high and low-quality wines.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA steps include:
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualized the correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
- **Boxplots**: Analyzed how features like fixed acidity and volatile acidity relate to wine quality.
- **Scatter Plots**: Explored the relationships between fixed acidity, pH, residual sugar, and alcohol content.
- **Point Plots**: Investigated the effects of citric acid and sulfur dioxide (SO2) on wine quality.
- **Pair Plot**: Examined pairwise relationships between selected features.

## Hypothesis Testing

A t-test was conducted to compare the alcohol content between high-quality (quality >= 7) and low-quality (quality <= 4) wines. Results indicate a significant difference, suggesting that alcohol content is a crucial factor influencing wine quality.

## Visualizations

The repository includes the following visualizations:
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Shows correlations between features.
- **Boxplots**: For fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and other features against quality.
- **Scatter Plots**: For relationships between fixed acidity and pH, residual sugar and alcohol, etc.
- **Point Plots**: For citric acid and sulfur dioxide versus wine quality.
- **Pair Plot**: Shows pairwise feature relationships.
- **Count Plot**: Displays the distribution of wine quality ratings.
